# Lecture Plan

### 1. DFS Visualizer

Step through the DFS algorithm on a small graph — trace the call stack, see how backtracking works, and understand why a single call to `exploreDFS(v)` is not enough for a disconnected graph. The third mode shows the outer loop in `DepthFirstSearch(G)` that handles disconnected components.

### 2. LeetCode Problem: Keys and Rooms

Apply DFS to a new graph problem. Given the DFS pattern from the visualizer, identify what the graph is, what the visited set tracks, and how to detect whether all rooms are reachable.

[Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/description/){:target="_blank"}

Input:  vector<vector<int>> rooms = [[1],[2, 3],[1],[]]
Output: ?

Discuss with your peer (5 mins):
1. What are the nodes and what are the edges in this problem?                                                                                                 
2. What does the input (rooms) represent in graph terms?

### 3. DFS Applied to PA03: Backpropagation

The neural network is a directed graph where edges only go forward. To compute the nudge (delta) for each weight, you need values from nodes in the next layer — but there is no backward edge to follow. The recursive DFS naturally solves this: dive to the output first, compute the error there, then pass results back up the call stack. A contributions map (memoization) ensures each node is computed only once.

**What this visualizer does not show — questions for the curious student:**

- How is the error signal at the output node actually computed? What formula seeds the backward pass, and where does it come from?
- Why do these weight updates actually make predictions better? What guarantees that subtracting a delta moves the network in the right direction?
- Why does the learning rate matter? What goes wrong if it is too large or too small?
- Why average the deltas across a batch of training examples rather than updating after each one?
